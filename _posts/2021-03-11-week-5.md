title: Week 5
---
Planning was a bit slow this week. Again, the problem from last week was that I was a bit busy with outside events so progress was slow. We did meet with the people from ISS and discussed a few things. Mostly the security of the server, what ports are opened up and how we were going to secure the server. It was more of a introductory kind of chat, to see us and have any questions we might have. A fairly uneventual week all things considered.
