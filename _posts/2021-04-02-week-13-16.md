#Week 13
During a day that I wasn't able to come to class, Alister demoed the server to Faisal. Faisal wasn't quite happy with every student having the same generic password. Which was an understandable concern but my thought was that it was a placeholder for the meantime while we tested things. Regardless, we both suggested changing it to the student ids as we knew that's the pretty obvious solution to all of this. He also wanted us to load test the server in case of a worst case scenario. He also wanted to ask if the machine IP was permenant which it was from the very start as when you shut down the server via Azure, you can ask it to reserve the IP address.

I also discussed with Alister about the new scripts I made but he was adament that they'd be more confusing than the current set up. So, I decided to scrap them and leave them on the server just in case.

Regardless, I let Alister sort out the student password issues while I went ahead and started work on the security server. The security server was essentially a replication server that Rob wants to make adjustments to as a test bed for changes to our current server. To make it was a bit more awkward than inteneded as I had to jump through a few hoops. I had to clone the disks then create a new OS from one of those disks. I decided upon using the same type of virtual machine as before but one tier down. With 1GB or RAM and 1 CPU, it was going to be a fairly simple server with pretty much the exact settings.

However once I created it, I noticed that I couldn't SSH into it via the administrator account that Rob wanted me to create. I believe this was something that Azure does as default as it edits the sshd_config file to match the same settings as the virtual machine. Considering that we made the server with a private key instead of a password, I simply logged in with the old admin account via a private key and changed the password authentication back on.

It took a bit longer than I intended to get things up and running, it even bled into the next week as I was a bit strapped for time. At first, the data disk for the security server corrupted so in a way I had never seen before. Thankfully, we just simply cloned the original disk back on and it was fine. But then there was issues with DNS. As I had to change the domain for the server to something new, for some strange reason, every time I tried to go onto the phpMyAdmin portal of the security server, it just redirected back to the original server. This was due to some old DNS records on my local machine that I had to clean out. But to also prevent this from happening in the future, I had Rob create a new name record for the server to live upon and changed everything on that server to point to the new address. There was some lingering DNS issues but I believe that is on my end rather than on the machines themselves.

This week I spent most of my time finishing up the security server and looking into perhaps creating a backup solution using Microsoft's Azure
