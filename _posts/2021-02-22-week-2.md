Week two was spent getting adjusted into the group, learning the structure and figuring out what was needed to work on. I was assigned to work on the migration of both the DB2 and DB3 class servers over to Azure along with Alister. We decided together that we would work on DB2 first as that is a much high priority due to needing to be done by the end of the semester.
