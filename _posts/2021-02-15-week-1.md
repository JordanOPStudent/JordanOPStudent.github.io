title: Week 1

The first week back was to get readjusted into the project. The last project I worked on was with the IoT team and since then, I've decided to work with the DevOps team for this semester instead since that's where I want to get experience in. 

It looked like this semester the DevOps team was going to focus on migrating all of the BIT services over to Microsoft Azure. I haven't had much experience in Azure before. Although last semester, I did take a course with Amazon Web Services and have previously worked with Linode (which is another web infrastructure hosting service) for my own private servers.
