title: Week 4
---
In week four, we presented our case for what we had planned for the DB2 server. Alister and I decided between two different strategies. Lift and Shift which was pretty much copying our set up from our current server to a virtual machine in Azure. The other was using AzureDB for MariaDB as it required less maintenance and work to be done and cost slightly less than hosting our own virtual machine. When we gave Rob the two ideas we had, he suggested we investigate the downsides of using the AzureDB solution over simply rolling our own VM. With that task, I investigated it.
