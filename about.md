Hello. I'm Jordan Chuikoff-Smillie (or Jordan Smillie, for short) and I am a student at Otago Polytechnic studying my final year of my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I'm someone who spends a lot of time working on servers, programming and drinking far too much caffeine that my kidneys can handle. I host my own little Pi servers at home for media servers, networking and I even have a remote server to act as my Google Drive replacement and email provider. I enjoy self-hosting and working a lot in that field and I dabble a bit in working on my own software projects whenever I can find the time.
