This week I decided to focus on figuring out the Azure platform in general. Seeing how it works and compare it to my experience using Amazon Web Services and Linode. As expected, it is far more comparable to the former than the latter as of course Amazon’s infrastructure is far greater in scale than Linode’s. I also helped with Alister’s documentation of what we planned to present to Rob.
