title: Week 2

Week two was spent getting adjusted into the group, learning the structure and figuring out what was needed to work on. Admittedly, a lot of the time was spent getting adjusted to the team, figuring things out and seeing how the team worked together. There were a few projected I was interested in but took the time to simply get adjusted.
