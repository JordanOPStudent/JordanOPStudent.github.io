title: Week 5

This week I finished up the document to compare between what we would gain and lose between the two different solutions. Like most documentation that I wrote up, it was kind of unnecessary. When we brought up the problems with Rob, he suggested we go with the lift and shift method as to ensure that the DB2 course does not have to change, we would have to run a separate VM to run PHPMyAdmin to access the database. Of course, that was going to be a bit too much to ask. So now, we were tasked with writing up specifications of what we will do with the server, the sever specifications and how weâ€™re going to set it up.
