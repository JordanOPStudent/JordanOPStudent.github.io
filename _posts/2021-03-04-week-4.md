After having our proposal approved, we set out about a plan for our server. Most of this was discussing with Alister about what software we'll put on the server. We were obviously going to try to stick to the current server's specs as much as possible, to make the transition seamless. However, not having full access to the server did make the task a little difficult to figure out. As far as I knew, there were only a couple key components. phpMyAdmin and mariaDB. Alister and I got to planning. However, due to being busy with other classes, this was going to be a bit slower than anticipated. I also used this time to become more familiar with Azure and perform a couple of experiments on my own. Just to try out Azure and get a good idea of everything.
